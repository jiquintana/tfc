""" This module defines an object type which can efficiently represent
an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point
numbers.  Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists,
except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.  The
type is specified at object creation time by using a type code, which
is a single character.  The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes 
    'c'         character          1 
    'b'         signed integer     1 
    'B'         unsigned integer   1 
    'u'         Unicode character  2 
    'h'         signed integer     2 
    'H'         unsigned integer   2 
    'i'         signed integer     2 
    'I'         unsigned integer   2 
    'l'         signed integer     4

  """ array(typecode [, initializer]) -> array
  
  Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
  initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
  string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.
  
  Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
  the type of objects stored in them is constrained.
  
  Methods:
  
  append() -- append a new item to the end of the array
  buffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info
  byteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array
  count() -- return number of occurrences of an object
  extend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable
  fromfile() -- read items from a file object
  fromlist() -- append items from the list
  fromstring() -- append items from the string
  index() -- return index of first occurrence of an object
  insert() -- insert a new item into the array at a provided position
  pop() -- remove and return item (default last)
  read() -- DEPRECATED, use fromfile()
  remove() -- remove first occurrence of an object
  reverse() -- reverse the order of the items in the array
  tofile() -- write all items to a file object
